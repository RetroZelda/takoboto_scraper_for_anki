fill out ./data/words_to_scrape.csv with all the words IDs you want in the "id_in" column.  The ID it looks for is found in the takoboto url for a word after "w=". https://takoboto.jp/?w=1001370 

Then run ./scrape.sh
Non verb words will get added to a "Japanese Words" deck, and the rest will be subdecks under a "Verb Conjugation" deck


NOTE: ./scrape.sh will just scrape.  you can modify ./synthesize.sh to set your deck name to then generate a spoken voice for each card in the deck. 

Synthesizing generally assumes you have the Takoboto deck type
